# Continuous wavelet transform approach for peptide detection in targeted proteomics (MRM/SRM) data.

## to run:
> runMRMDetective.py [raw file name]

## Example output
* red dots denote peaks detected in each transition channels
* aligned peaks is likely to be a peptide
* scoring is based on signal-to-noise ratios and transition aligment in time
